# Transmog
This is a simple plugin that allows blocks to be switched when broken.  For example you might break a dirt block but be given a piece of wood or red wool.  Not all blocks are able to be transmogrified into other blocks and the outcome of breaking a block will always be the same even after a server reset.

Currently this will only work on versions 1.8 to 1.12.2 minecraft.  So as a disclaimer this will not work on 1.13 and above.
